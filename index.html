            a Campaign contributing to climate change through clean air
            coalition and fighting hunger through mass food production through

        <span> LEAF- LIVES AFRICA </span>
        was founded by the end of 2021, inspired by the effects of COVID 19 that
        left many homes in despair. The pandemic which left many families in
        poverty, hunger, deaths and unplanned child rates. The program was
        birthed to solve such kind of emergencies in our communities. Hunger was
        at its peak since many African homes survive on a daily bread with no
        emergency income to sustain them. Poverty followed as there was no
        source of income as every economic activity stood still. The increase in
        high medical bills which could not be catered for by the poor
        communities led to loss of lives and left many families losing the
        little they have; finally increase unplanned child births came last in
        communities that were already not doing well.
