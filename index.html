      <p>
        <span> LEAF- LIVES AFRICA </span>
        was founded by the end of 2021, inspired by the effects of COVID 19 that
        left many homes in despair. The pandemic which left many families in
        poverty, hunger, deaths and unplanned child rates. The program was
        birthed to solve such kind of emergencies in our communities. Hunger was
        at its peak since many African homes survive on a daily bread with no
        emergency income to sustain them. Poverty followed as there was no
        source of income as every economic activity stood still. The increase in
        high medical bills which could not be catered for by the poor
        communities led to loss of lives and left many families losing the
        little they have; finally increase unplanned child births came last in
        communities that were already not doing well.

                <p>A good lesson learnt from COVID-19 was hunger, poverty in families. It's very essential to know women being part of global matters since they are always on the frontline in everything. Women give life, they exercise and nurture lives too. Therefore, it would be a better world as women champion these matters to solve the world-be poverty, hunger in single mother families too.</p>

                <p>Many outcomes of the COVID-19 are increased single mothers who are young, illiterate, in poverty and therefore cannot even sustain their families. Our youth training and empowerment program comes to train them and educate them how to navigate and sustain life through involvement in agricultural practices for not only consumption but also sell in order to afford education and medical bills for their children. This will also help fight poverty among the young generation who are the future of tomorrow.</p>
