            <p>We should be very honest for centuries we have robbed from Mother Nature. The land that feeds us, accommodates us and shelters us through pollution, extracting minerals for our own good, cut down trees for personal gains and survival. It would be a great thing if we gave back to nature. The best way to give back to nature is through restoration and conservation, start with what you have and where you are. We believe that planting a diversity of trees would create a change and enhance the health of our world.
                This will lead to reduced global warming, climate changes improved quality in the air we breathe, and abundant rainfall in our communities to support living organisms and agriculture. It will provide shelter for the animal kingdom and support aquatic life too. With the above mentioned we shall have a bright future in the world for us and the future Generation.
